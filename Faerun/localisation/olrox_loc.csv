wonder_netherese_enclave_desc;The discovery and development of mythallars by Netherese arcanists allowed them to develop the spells necessary to create their floating enclaves, bastions of enlightenment, peace and ingenuity, giving the mages of Netheril sanctuaries from which they could continue their arcane research, safe from the distractions and dangers of the surface world.;;;;;;;;;x

wonder_shade;Shade;;;;;;;;;x
wonder_shade_desc;Thultanthar, now known as Shade, was created 1471 years before the Dalereckoning calendar. High mage Telamont had been experimenting with the Plane of Shadow for some time and had successfully shifted the entire city into the Plane of Shadow mere days before Karsus cast Karsus's Avatar and temporarily destroyed the Weave in the Year of Sundered Webs. Eventually, they managed to return to Netheril, or at least what was left of it. Searching for survivors for days, the city floated over the ruins of the Netherese empire. Finding none, the high mage assumed it was he work of the phaerimm and began planning his revenge. He stopped, however, when he realized that one city was not a match for them and that his subjects were likely the last of the empire's people. He abandoned those plans and retreated back into the Plane of Shadow, vowing that one day, they would return and reestablish the empire.;;;;;;;;;x
